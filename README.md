# SMS-Spam-Classifier

Project Overview: The objective was to develop a model capable of accurately classifying SMS messages as either spam or ham. This task entailed working with extensive datasets, performing feature engineering, and implementing various algorithms to achieve high accuracy.

Key Steps and Achievements:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset of SMS messages to ensure high-quality input for the model.

Model Training: Trained multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines, to optimize classification accuracy.

By leveraging a machine learning model, I successfully distinguished between spam and ham (non-spam) messages.
